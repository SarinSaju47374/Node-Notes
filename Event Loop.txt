Synchronous code Execution in node Js

Whenever variables are declared the memory is allocated in Memory Heap
When the code is executed the function is pushed into the call stack and pops after 
execution(LIFO).

Whenever an async method is executed it will be offloaded to libuv which is then 
handled using native async mechanisms and if thats not possible it will be handled 
using Thread Pool ensuring so that the main thread aint blocked.


Event Loop 
Its a C program and is a part of libuv

A design pattern that orchestrates or co-ordinates the execution of synchronous and 
asynchronous code in Node js.
