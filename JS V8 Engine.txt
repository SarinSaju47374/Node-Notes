Javascript code cannot be  understood by computer.

A Javascript engine is a program that converts the JS code that developers write to machine
code that allows computer to perform specific tasks.

V8 - Open source Js engine developed by Google for Chrome (Written in C++)
Spidermonkey - Js engine powering Mozilla Firefox
JavaScriptCore - Open source Js engine developed by Apple for safari
Chakra - Js engine that uses V8 powering Microsoft Edge.




V8 is written in C++ and can be used independently or can be embedded in other C++ programs like
Node js. 

The features available in C++ and not in JS can be used using Node js.
