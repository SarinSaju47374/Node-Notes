/*
How it moves throughout the event loop for above code execution ?ðŸ¤¯

After Call stack executes the code in the code snippet we endup 
with a callback in nextTick queue,Promise queue and Timer queue.

Rememeber that the I/O queue is empty cuz I/O polling hasnt been
completed yet. 

Now the Control moves into the nextTick queue and 
dequeues the callback and executes it. 

Since NextTick is empty the 
control moves to Promise queue and dequeues the callback and executes
it.

Since Promise queue is empty the control moves to Timer Queue ,deques the callback 
funciton and executes it . 

Then comes the I/O queue which is empty. Then begins the I/O polling phase which 
checks whether the readFile operation is complete or not . If its complete it 
pushes the associated callback to the I/O queue

During that phase the Event loop proceeds to check the Check queue and see the callback
function, dequeues it and executes it . 

Then Event loop further proceeds to check the close queue and see its empty.

Event Loop then Proceeds to second iteration and checks that Microtask queue(nextTick and Promise queue) , Timer queue is empty.

Then Checks the I/O queue which is having a callback function which was pushed in prev
iteration in I/O polling phase. The callback Funciton is dequeued adn executed and checks the 
further queues.

ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ As Event loop further moves to other queue it repeatedly checks the Microtask Queue.

Now here the setImmediate was executed after the I/O execution ....Amazing Right!ðŸ˜ƒ
