What is NPM?

NPM stands for Node Package Manager. It is a Javascript package manager and 
the default package manager for Node projects. NPM is installed when NodeJS 
is installed on a machine. It comes with a command-line interface (CLI) used 
to interact with the online database of NPM. , and it hosts public and private
'packages.' To add or update packages, we use the NPM CLI to interact with this
database. 

Isaac Z. Schlueter developed NPM purely in Javascript. It was first released in
November 2010. Ever since, NPM has had a lot of updates and has improved 
in terms of efficiency, speed and security. 


Conclusion:-
  * NPM is a package manager used to install, delete, and update Javascript 
    packages on your machine.
  * NPM installs packages globally, which means that your machine may be polluted
    by packages that are not required anymore in the long run. 
  * To use create-react-app using NPM, we would first have to install it globally, 
    and then run it, which makes using NPM in such cases redundant. 


What is NPX?

NPX stands for Node Package eXecute. It is simply an NPM package runner. It allows 
developers to execute any Javascript Package available on the NPM registry without 
even installing it. NPX is installed automatically with NPM version 5.2.0 and above.

**** The primary use case of NPX  is when we need to use a particular package just once.
     In such cases, first installing it and then executing it becomes a very redundant task. 
     This is why NPX is a powerful tool. 
	 
Conclusion:-
  * NPX is a package executer, and it is used to execute javascript packages directly, 
    without installing them. 
  * NPX does not install packages, so package pollution on the machine is not a concern. 
  * The most common application of NPX is the create-react-app command. Since we only need
    to use it once, i.e., while initializing the project, we do not install it.
