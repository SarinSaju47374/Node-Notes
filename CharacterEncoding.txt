I hope Binary data is pretty straight forward!!
Computers store and represent data in binary format which is a collection of Os and 1s
Each 0 or 1 is called a binary digit or bit for short To work with a piece of data, a 
computer needs to convert that data into its binary representation.

eg.

1 - 1
2 - 10
3 - 11
4 - 100  

Its just Base 2 Numeric system.

 1     0     0
2^2   2^1   2^0    

1 is present above 2^2 which is 4

 1     1     0
2^2   2^1   2^0 

1 is present above 2^1 and 2^2 which is 2^1+2^2 = 6


>> Characters to Binary Format

Characters are converted to Number Based on Character Sets and then converted 
to Binary representation
Character Sets are predefined lists of characters represented by numbers

Unicode and ASCII are character sets which are the most popular ones
In browser console if you run "V".charCodeAt() we will get 86 which is a unicode.


>> Character Encoding

Character encoding dictates how to represent a number in a character set as binary data
before it can be stored in a computer
It dictates how many bits to use to represent the number
Example of a character encoding system is UTF-8
UTF-8 states that characters should be encoded in bytes (8 bits)
Eight 1s or Os should be used to represent the code of any character in binary
4 => 100 => 00000100

V => 86 => 01010110

Similar guidelines also exist on how images and videos should be encoded and stored in 
binary format
